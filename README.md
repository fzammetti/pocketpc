A repository of my old PocketPC stuff

Here you will find a collection of >10 year old code for a number of products I released on the PocketPC platform under the Omnytex banner.  All of these games (and one app) has been available for free from my site for some time, but who cares, not like anyone is going to ever run them!  But, what the hell, as a matter of personal history I'm dumping this here for all the world to see (even the embarassing parts - and there's certainly plenty of that as far as the code goes!)
