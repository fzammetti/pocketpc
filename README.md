# pocketpc
A repository of my old PocketPC stuff

Here you will find a collection of >10 year old code for a number of products I released on the PocketPC platform under the Omnytex banner.  All of these games (and one app) has been available for free from my site for some time, but who cares, not like anyone is going to ever run them!  But, what the hell, as a matter of personal history I'm dumping this here for all the world to see (even the embarassing parts - and there's certainly plenty of that as far as the code goes!)

* **electro** - the one app that I actually made some money from back then, this is a reference/calculator app for electronics technicians
  
* **eliminator** - the first game I wrote for PocketPC, it's the old peg-jumping game we all used to play in Friendly's
  
* **GXLib** - a graphics library that I wrote back then
  
* **invasion_trivia** - the first appearance of Krelmac and Gentoo (otherwise known as K&G), two wisecracking aliens who have come to Earth to destroy us... but only after a trivia contest!
  
* **kgarcade** - K&G Arcade, a game where K&G abduct you, so you have to find your way out of their ship by playing mini-games, for some odd reason, and avoiding teleporting robots (interesting note: I couldn't get the robots to move the way I really wanted them to for some reason, hence they became teleporting robots!  A total copout, but it actually made them more challenging to deal with, so it worked out in the end.)
  
* **OmnyGUI** - a GUI toolkit I wrote.
  
* **SXLib** - an audio library that I wrote back then
