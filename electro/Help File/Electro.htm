<a name="Introduction"></a>
<b>Introduction</b>
<br>
Electro is a comprehensive collection of useful tools for the electronics technician and
electrician.
<br><br>
It is organized into two sections, Tools and Reference:
<br><br>
<i>Tools</i> - This menu contains a number of calculators and utilities to help in design and
engineering tasks.
<br><br>
<i>Reference</i> - This menu contains various reference tables and collections of information
that may be helpful in day-to-day electronics and electrical work.
<br><br>
You can move around the program by selecting either the Tools or Reference menu and then selecting
the item you'd like to use.  You can freely move around to various screens at any time, there is
no need to close each individual screen when you are done.  In fact, if you use a particular tool and
go to another and later return to the first, it will be exactly as you left it, you won't loose an
calculations or anything else as you move from screen to screen.
<br><br>
You can access help for the screen you are currently viewing by clicking the question mark on the
toolbar.  You can of course always view the complete help file by selecting Help... under the Help menu.
<br><br>
You can exit Electro at any time by clicking Exit on the Tools menu.
<br><br>
If you find any bugs in the program, please send eMail to fzammetti@omnytex.com.  You can also send any
suggestions for additions to that same address.  We are always thinking of future versions
and what we can put in to make Electro the best program of it's kind for the PopketPC.
<br><br>
Thank you very much for your purchase and we hope you fine Electro helpful in your work!
