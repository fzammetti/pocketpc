 * Installation Problems *
 *************************

 1. Sometimes for some odd reason, ActiveSync will complain about the 
    program being installed not being correct for the device you are trying 
    to install to.

    This is a known issue which is being investigated.  However, for the 
    time being, there is a simple work-around.

    After unzipping the archive appropriate for your device, you will find 
    a file called InvasionTrivia.xxx.CAB in the folder you unzipped to, 
    where xxx is the CPU type (ARM, MIPS or SH3).  You can manually copy 
    this file to your device as you would any other file (by accessing the 
    Mobile Device listed in Windows Explorer or My Computer).  Once it is 
    on your device, execute the file manager of your choice, navigate to 
    the folder where you copied the CAB file to, and execute it.  
    Installation should procede normally from there.


 *****************************
 * Problems Running The Game *
 *****************************

 1. This game is rather sensitive to low memory conditions, especially
    during startup.  The game will not execute if there is less than 14M
    of free memory (total memory, i.e., program and storage memory combined).
    
    If during loading, the game simply exits with no message, this is almost
    certainly due to not enough memory.  Please free up 14M of free memory total
    and try again.

    Note that the 14M can be distributed between program RAM and
    storage RAM in any way, the game should function properly as long as there is
    a total of 14M free memory.
