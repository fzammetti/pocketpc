Hekkus Sound System is now Donate-Ware.
If you have used Hekkus on your game and have earn enought money 
please make a donation. 
Something like from 25 to 50 euro will be very appreciated, 
but if you think you don't have sell enough and you still want 
to donate something feel free to donate the amount you feel right.

You can freely use Hekkus on your free or commercial product but you have 
to write somewhere on your game a little credit string, something like 
'Sound provided by Hekkus Sound System - http://www.shlzero.com'.
You HAVE also to send me an e-mail for every game you want to release
