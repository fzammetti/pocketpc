v1.6 - 11/1/2005
----------------
* Freeware version distributed by ClickGamer

v1.1 - 4/30/2004
----------------
* Fixed a bug that would cause the game to crash when exiting Trouble In Vectropolis played in Melee mode
* Added high scores for mini-games
* Changed slightly the text of the credit scroller
* Chaged text on New Game selection screen from "Until I Say Stop" to "Play Until I Say Stop" when selecting
  mini-game sub-mode in Melee mode
* Lowered required scores somewhat for Trouble In Vectropolis, Muncher Dude and The Bogaz Derby
* Changed code so that mini-game scores only count towards the overall score in Adventure mode when the
  minimum score is achieved (previously counted regardless of the outcome of the mini-game)
* When exiting a mini-game manually, it will now check to see if you achieved the minimum score in
  Adventure mode (so you no longer have to "play out the clock" if you don't want to).  It also
	does this in Melee mode for high score checking.  In both cases, you will see the Game Over screen
	when you exit now rather than just immediately exiting.
